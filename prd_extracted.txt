1. Executive Summary 
AetherOS is a browser-native operating system simulator designed to model 
fundamental operating system mechanisms while presenting a modern desktop-style 
interface. The system combines deterministic kernel simulation, real-time visualization, 
AI-powered system introspection, persistent backend storage using a self-hosted 
Supabase instance, containerized infrastructure using Docker, and global content 
delivery via Cloudflare. 
The platform demonstrates full-stack engineering across systems simulation, frontend 
architecture, backend integration, artificial intelligence tooling, containerization, 
infrastructure deployment, and DevOps workflow management. 
 
2. Problem Statement 
Operating Systems concepts such as CPU scheduling, virtual memory paging, and disk 
allocation are often difficult to internalize through static diagrams and textbook 
explanations. Students frequently understand theoretical definitions but struggle to 
visualize how scheduling policies impact fairness, how page faults degrade 
performance, how thrashing occurs under memory pressure, and how disk 
fragmentation accumulates over time. 
There is currently no accessible, browser-based platform that integrates deterministic 
OS simulation with real-time visualization and conversational AI explanations. 
AetherOS addresses this gap by providing an interactive, web-native operating system 
laboratory. 
 
3. Product Vision 
AetherOS is envisioned as a deterministic OS laboratory, a visual systems simulation 
platform, and an AI-assisted diagnostic environment. The system bridges operating 
systems theory with practical visualization and conversational reasoning. It is designed 
not merely as a simulator but as a systems-level platform that demonstrates 
competence in frontend engineering, backend infrastructure, database architecture, 
artificial intelligence integration, and containerized deployment. 
 
4. System Architecture Overview 
The architecture of AetherOS is divided into five primary layers. 
The Simulation Kernel runs inside a Web Worker to prevent UI blocking. It operates as a 
deterministic, tick-based state machine responsible for managing processes, memory, 
disk allocation, scheduling decisions, and event emission. It maintains authoritative 
system state and communicates updates to the frontend via structured messages. 
The Frontend Visualization Layer is built using React and TypeScript with Vite as the 
build tool and Tailwind CSS for styling. Zustand is used for UI state management. The 
frontend renders the desktop shell, window manager, process visualizations, RAM and 
disk grids using the Canvas API, event logs, CLI interface, and application windows. 
The Persistence Layer is implemented using a self-hosted Supabase instance backed 
by PostgreSQL. Supabase and PostgreSQL are deployed using Docker containers to 
ensure portability, reproducibility, and environment consistency across development 
and production systems. This layer stores simulation configurations, serialized system 
snapshots, AI conversation history, and scenario templates. 
The AI Proxy Layer is deployed as either a Cloudflare Worker or a Node-based backend 
service. When using a Node backend, it is containerized using Docker to maintain 
consistent runtime environments and simplify deployment. This layer secures access to 
the OpenAI API, implements tool-based AI interaction, enforces rate limiting, and 
ensures that API keys remain server-side. 
The AI Assistant Layer utilizes the OpenAI Responses API with tool-calling capabilities. 
The AI interacts with structured tools such as system_snapshot, process_inspect, 
memory_stats, disk_stats, trace_recent, and apply_policy, ensuring that AI explanations 
are grounded in actual simulation data. 
 
5. Operating System Features (80/20 Implementation) AetherOS implements a focused subset of operating system features that create a 
realistic desktop experience without excessive complexity. 
The Desktop Shell includes a window manager with drag, resize, minimize, and 
maximize capabilities. It provides a taskbar or dock, an application launcher, a system 
tray displaying CPU, RAM, and disk usage statistics, and a clock. 
The Settings Application allows modification of system-level simulation parameters 
such as scheduling policy, time slice duration, total memory size, disk size, theme 
mode, and AI operating mode. 
The File Manager supports directory navigation, file creation, file deletion, renaming, 
and disk block visualization. All file metadata and allocation data are managed by the 
simulated disk subsystem. 
The Command Line Interface provides commands for process listing, process 
termination, workload spawning, memory statistics retrieval, disk statistics retrieval, 
directory navigation, file creation and deletion, and AI-based explanation of events. 
The Simple Browser uses an iframe-based sandbox to allow real internet browsing. 
While rendering real web content, it behaves as a simulated process consuming virtual 
CPU time and memory. 
The Task Manager displays process tables, CPU usage, memory usage, and allows 
process termination. 
The AI Assistant provides real-time system explanations, performance diagnostics, 
policy suggestions, scenario generation, and event interpretation. 
 
6. Kernel Simulation Details 
The Process Management subsystem defines each process with attributes including 
PID, state, priority, time slice remaining, memory allocation, workload script, and 
runtime metrics. Round Robin scheduling is required, while Multi-Level Feedback 
Queue may be implemented as an advanced feature. 
The Memory Management subsystem models physical memory as fixed-size frames and 
implements per-process page tables. Page fault handling and Clock-based page 
replacement are core requirements. 
The Storage Simulation subsystem models disk storage as a fixed block array with a 
free-space bitmap. File allocation uses a FAT-style or simplified inode-based approach. 
Disk I/O is simulated using latency measured in ticks, during which processes transition 
to a waiting state. 
 7. Infrastructure and Deployment 
The system is deployed at aetheros.necookie.dev using Cloudflare DNS. Cloudflare 
Pages provides frontend hosting and global CDN delivery with automatic HTTPS. The 
backend AI proxy runs on Cloudflare Workers or as a Dockerized Node service. The 
database layer is powered by a self-hosted Supabase instance using PostgreSQL, 
containerized via Docker for portability and environment consistency. 
Docker ensures reproducible builds, simplified deployment, isolated services, and 
scalable backend infrastructure management. 
 
8. Development and Technology Stack 
The frontend stack includes React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Zustand, and 
xterm.js. 
The backend stack includes Cloudflare Workers or Node.js, the OpenAI Responses API, 
and Supabase with PostgreSQL. 
The infrastructure stack includes Docker for containerization, Supabase for backend 
services, and Cloudflare for CDN, DNS, and edge deployment. 
Development tools include Git for version control, GitHub for repository hosting and 
CI/CD integration, Visual Studio Code as the primary IDE, Google Antigravity IDE for AI-
assisted development, and Codex CLI for rapid code generation and refactoring. 
 
9. Performance Constraints 
The system targets 60 frames per second for UI responsiveness and supports at least 
fifty simulated processes. The kernel must operate entirely off the main thread, and 
snapshot serialization should complete within one hundred milliseconds. 
 
10. Security Considerations 
OpenAI API keys are stored server-side only. Supabase credentials are secured via 
environment variables and container configuration. Dockerized services isolate 
backend components. AI endpoints are rate-limited, and optional Row-Level Security 
may be enabled for multi-user expansion. 
 
11. Future Expansion Future enhancements may include multi-core CPU simulation, swap space modeling, 
Translation Lookaside Buffer simulation, Rust-to-WASM kernel migration, network stack 
simulation, collaborative multi-user sessions, and scalable container orchestration 
using Docker Compose or Kubernetes. 
 
12. Strategic Value 
AetherOS demonstrates competence in operating systems theory, deterministic 
simulation modeling, AI tool integration, modern frontend architecture, backend 
engineering, PostgreSQL database design, containerized infrastructure using Docker, 
CDN deployment, and DevOps practices. 
It represents a full-stack systems and AI platform deployed on modern cloud 
infrastructure.
